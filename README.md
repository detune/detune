**Detune** is a clean, modern, asynchronous, feature-rich pseudo-reddit discussion software built from the ground up in **Golang** and is maintained by [Ettudis](mailto:rkniuet@ambriel.net) & [Rune](mailto:urmail@yahoo.com)
#### Design Goals
- **Asynchronous Design**. User interface powered by VueJS, a ~24kb (min + gzip) JavaScript framework to make the application more performant.
- **VelocityJS**. The best animations engine to make transitions smoother transitions compared to jQuery & CSS.
- **Jade** simply simplifying the simplified.

#### Where is the Code?

There's no code as of yet since we're still making it :3

#### Will an open-source license be added to this repo?

Yes, once there's a code.
