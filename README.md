**Detune** is a clean, modern, asynchronous, feature-rich pseudo-reddit discussion software built from the ground up in **Golang**.
#### Design Goals
- **Asynchronous Design**. User interface powered by VueJS, a ~24kb (min + gzip) JavaScript framework to make the application more performant.
- **VelocityJS**. The best animations engine to make transitions smoother transitions compared to jQuery & CSS.
- **Jade** simply simplifying the simplified.

#### Where is the Code?

There's no code as of yet since we're still making it.  Currently, the software deployed on the production website is called ZeonBBS, written in CodeIgniter 2.  We are looking to replace it with a more modern code.  After a few forays in Laravel, we got frustrated by how complex the code had become and thus, we went off looking for other solutions to lessen our headaches.  We might have just found it in Go.

#### Will an open-source license be added to this repo?

Yes, once there's a code.
